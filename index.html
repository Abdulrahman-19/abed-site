        <h1>what is Grocery store</h1>
        <p id="colored">Grocery stores specialize in the selling of food, both fresh and prepackaged, as well as nonfood household goods, 
            such as paper towels, toilet paper, cleaning products and over-the-counter medicines. A typical grocery store sells fresh produce,
            meats, dairy products and, often, bakery goods alongside canned, frozen and prepared foods. 
            In addition, a grocery store will also sell a full range of household, healthcare and personal care items.</p>
